    <h2>History</h2>
    <div class="content-section">
        <p><i>Super Mario 64</i> (or SM64, for short) is a platform game developed and published by Nintendo
            for the Nintendo 64 console. It was released in both North America and Japan in 1996 and for the PAL regions
            in 1997. It's the first <i>Super Mario</i> game to feature 3D gameplay that combines traditional <i>Super Mario</i> gameplay,
            visual style, and characters in a large open world.

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <div class="content-section">
            <p><i>Super Mario 64</i> is a 3D platformer in which the player controls Mario through various courses.
            Mario's abilities are far more diverse than in previous games. He can walk, jump, crouch, crawl, climb, swim,
            kick, grab objects, and punch using the game controller's analog stick and buttons. He can also execute special 
            jumps by combining a regular jump with other actions, including the double jump and triple jumps, long jump, backflip,
            and wall jump. The player can adjust the camera—operated by Lakitu—and toggle between first-person and third-person view.

        <h2>Health, lives, and power-ups</h2>
            <div class="content-section">
            <p>
                Unlike many of its predecessors, <i>Super Mario 64</i> uses a health point system,
                represented by a pie shape consisting of 8 segments. If Mario has taken damage, he can replenish his health by 
                either collecting three types of coins—yellow, which replenishes one segment; red, equal to two yellow coins; and blue,
                which are equal to 5 yellow coins—or by walking through a spinning heart.
                However, if he is underwater, then his health is represented by how long he can hold his breath, which slowly diminishes while underwater
                and replenishes while above the surface. Instead of the typical power-ups found in other games, 
                such as fire flowers and Super Mushroom, there are three colored blocks. 
                Those being red, green, and blue; all of which have three switches of the same colors. 
                The red block contains the wing cap which allows Mario to fly, the green block that contains the metal cap, which makes him immune to enemies,
                fire, noxious gases, etc. and the blue block contains the vanish cap, which makes Mario invisible.

            <h2>All-time favorite</h2>
            <div class="content-section">
            <p>Everyone who's ever played on the N64 can atest the amazing game that is <i>Super Mario 64.</i>
                It truely is a one-of-a-kind when it comes to platform games and is loved by all. Even after almost 30 years of its 
                existence, <i>Super Mario 64</i> has made an impression on everyone that has the pleasure of playing. It is a remarkable
                achievement from Nintendo by creating the first 3D Mario game at the time. It's certainly a personal favorite of mine and I intend to keep
                it within my possession for as long as I can.
